# AI-Assisted Adaptive Firewall with SIEM Analytics

## Problem Statement
Traditional firewalls rely on static rules and signature-based detection, which fail to detect novel attacks and abnormal network behavior.

## Solution Overview
This project implements an AI-assisted adaptive firewall prototype that analyzes network traffic behavior, detects anomalies using machine learning, and provides SIEM-style visibility for security decision-making.
